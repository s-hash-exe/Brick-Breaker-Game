# Project Description:
Modeling  real world objects is the crux of an Object Oriented Programming language.
This aspect of such a language has made the field of game development a lot simpler. This project is intended to recreate the classic game -The Brick Builder using the OOP concepts and the different frameworks to model the elements to the game. Java being an object oriented programming language which also supports frameworks such as Swing GUI Library, has been used to build the project. 

The objective of this game is to break the bricks that are distributed around the top of the game screen. The bricks are broken after coming in contact with a ball that bounces around the screen. At the bottom is a paddle that moves based on user input. The input can be a right or left redirection. The user has to make sure the ball bounces off the paddle without going off the bottom of the screen. If the ball misses the paddle and goes off to the bottom of the screen before all the bricks have been broken, the game prompts as “Game Over”. While, if all the bricks are broken, the player wins.

# Individual Contribution:
1. Shantanu Agrawal : Designing the Main Class - To sync all the isolated elements.
2. Shashwat Agarwal : Designing the Frame containing the map of bricks, ball and paddle.
3. Shashwat Samarpan : Controlling Activity- KeyPressed events and respective actions to be performed.
4. Shreevatsa U Upadhyaya : Mapping and de-mapping of bricks. Tracking the collision events.
